## Configuration for public/config/tsocks
##

# Not many programs support SOCKS proxy forwarding natively (hardly any CLI 
# programs). But there is a workaround for that: tsocks. It enables arbitrary 
# programs which don't support the SOCKS protocol natively to establish 
# connections via a SOCKS server.

## Local networks
## For this example this machine can directly access 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0 
## (192.168.0.*) and 10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0 (10.*)
local = []
local += "192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0"
local += "10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0"


## Default server
## For connections that aren't to the local subnets or to 150.0.0.0/255.255.0.0
## the server at 192.168.0.1 should be used (again, hostnames could be used
## too, see note above)
server = "127.0.0.1"
## Server type defaults to 4 so we need to specify it as 5 for this one
server_type = "5"
## The port defaults to 1080 but I've stated it here for clarity 
server_port = "3080"
