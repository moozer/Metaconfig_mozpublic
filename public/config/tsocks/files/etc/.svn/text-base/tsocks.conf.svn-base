%header("##")
## This is the configuration for libtsocks (transparent socks)
## Lines beginning with # and blank lines are ignored
##
## The basic idea is to specify:
##	- Local subnets - Networks that can be accessed directly without
##			  assistance from a socks server
##	- Paths - Paths are basically lists of networks and a socks server
##		  which can be used to reach these networks
##	- Default server - A socks server which should be used to access 
##			   networks for which no path is available
## Much more documentation than provided in these comments can be found in
## the man pages, tsocks(8) and tsocks.conf(8)
#foreach l in local
  local = %(l)
#end

## Paths
## For this example this machine needs to access 150.0.0.0/255.255.0.0 as 
## well as port 80 on the network 150.1.0.0/255.255.0.0 through
## the socks 5 server at 10.1.7.25 (if this machines hostname was 
## "socks.hello.com" we could also specify that, unless --disable-hostnames
## was specified to ./configure).

##path {
##	reaches = 150.0.0.0/255.255.0.0
##	reaches = 150.1.0.0:80/255.255.0.0
##	server = 10.1.7.25
##	server_type = 5
##	default_user = delius
##	default_pass = hello
##}

server = %(server)
server_type = %(server_type)
